NServiceBus Message Endpoint Host Service

USAGE:
	NServiceBus.Host.exe [/install	[/serviceName]
					[/displayName]
					[/description]
					[/instance]
					[/startManually]
					[/username]
					[/password]] |
			     [/uninstall[/serviceName]
					[/instance]]
										
OPTIONS:

/install	Install the message endpoint as a Windows service
/serviceName	Specify the service name for the installed service
/displayName	Friendly name for the installed service
/description	Description for the service
/instance	Specify the unique name of the service instance you wish to install
		ex: "NServiceBus.Host.exe /install /instance:Instance5"
/startManually	Specifies that the service should start manually
/username	Username for the account the service should run under
/password	Password for the service account

If no service name is specified NServiceBus will use the full name of the discovered
endpoint configuration class (that which implements NServiceBus.IConfigureThisEndpoint)
along with the version number of the assembly it is contained within, for example:

	MyPublisher.Endpoint_v1.0.0.0
	
The default for the display name is the same value as the service name, and the description
defaults to a generic NServiceBus host description.

If you set the service name and/or instance name during installation you will need to specify
them when uninstalling them as well, ex:

	NServiceBus.Host.exe /uninstall /serviceName:"MyPublisher" /instance:Instance89
	
EXAMPLES:
	NServiceBus.Host.exe /install /serviceName:"MyPublisher" /displayName:"My Publisher Service"
		/description:"Service for publishing event messages" /username:"corp\serviceuser"
		/password:"p@ssw0rd!" NServiceBus.Production
